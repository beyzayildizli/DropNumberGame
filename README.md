# DATA STRUCTURES PROJECT 1
## DropNumberGame

#### Description:
In this project, we are expected to develop a program in Java programming language that imitates the game known as “drop number”, using linked list data structure. In the game, the number given by the user is added to the top of the desired position on the 5x7 game table and the same overlapping values are combined. When 7 elements overlap, the game is over and does not add any more values.

#### What I learned:
I learned how to connect the Linked List structure and the nodes in a linked list in as many different 
directions as we want.

#### Here's how the bottom line node-to-node connection works:
