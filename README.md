# DATA STRUCTURES PROJECT 1
## DropNumberGame

#### What You Want From Us:
In this project, we are expected to develop a program in Java programming language that imitates the 
game known as “drop number”, using linked list data structure.

#### What I learned:
I learned how to connect the Linked List structure and the nodes in a linked list in as many different 
directions as we want.
